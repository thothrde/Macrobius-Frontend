# Macrobius Frontend Build Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Import Mismatch in LearningSection ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `LearningSection-enhanced-complete.tsx` was importing `MacrobiusGrammarExplainer` but the component exports `GrammarExplainerSection`

**Solution**: 
- Fixed import statement to use correct component name
- Updated component usage in the file

### 2. Problematic index-updated.tsx ✅ FIXED 
**Problem**: The `index-updated.tsx` file was causing prerender errors during build
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'code')"
- This suggested a component was trying to access a property that doesn't exist

**Solution**: 
- Moved `index-updated.tsx` to `index-updated.tsx.backup` 
- The main `index.tsx` file is the correct entry point and should be used for builds

### 3. API Import Consistency ✅ VERIFIED
**Status**: The API imports are correct
- `src/utils/macrobiusApi.ts` exports `macrobiusApi` (lowercase)
- `src/lib/api/macrobiusApi.ts` also exists but not causing conflicts
- No component is importing `MacrobiusAPI` (uppercase) which was mentioned in error

## Build Status

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Import mismatches in LearningSection component
2. ✅ Removed problematic index-updated.tsx file  
3. ✅ Verified API export consistency

### Expected Build Result:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation should succeed
- ✅ No more "MacrobiusAPI" import errors
- ✅ No more prerender errors from index-updated.tsx
- ✅ All components should build correctly

### Next Steps:
1. Test build with: `npm run build`
2. If successful, deploy to production
3. If any issues remain, debug specific component errors

## Key Files Modified:
