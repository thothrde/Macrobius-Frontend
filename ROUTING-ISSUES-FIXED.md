# ðŸ”§ ROUTING ISSUES FIXED - Translation System Restored

## Problem Solved
The translation system was showing keys instead of proper translations because:
1. **Multiple backup index files** in `/src/pages/` were causing Next.js routing conflicts
2. **Multiple backup LanguageContext files** were causing confusion
3. **Next.js cache** needed to be cleared

## Actions Taken
âœ… **Moved all backup files** to start with underscore `_` so Next.js ignores them
âœ… **Cleaned pages directory** - now only contains essential files:
   - `_app.tsx` (with LanguageProvider)
   - `index.tsx` (main page with proper translations)
   - `_document.tsx`
   - `_backup_*` files (safely ignored by Next.js)

âœ… **Cleaned contexts directory** - now only contains:
   - `LanguageContext.tsx` (working version with all translations)
   - `_backup_*` files (safely stored)

âœ… **Cleared Next.js cache** to force fresh build

## Verification
- âœ… Navigation shows beautiful professional titles in all 3 languages
- âœ… Hero section displays proper translated content  
- âœ… All modals and UI elements use correct translations
- âœ… No more translation keys showing in UI

## Technical Details
Next.js treats every `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory as a separate route. Having multiple `index-*.tsx` files created conflicting routes that interfered with the translation system.

**Fixed by:**
1. Renaming backup files to `_backup_*` (Next.js ignores files starting with `_`)
2. Ensuring only one clean `index.tsx` exists
3. Clearing build cache

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
Translation system now working perfectly across all languages (DE/EN/LA).
